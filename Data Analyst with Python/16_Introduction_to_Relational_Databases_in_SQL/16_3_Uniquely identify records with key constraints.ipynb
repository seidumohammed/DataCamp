    "## Keys and superkeys\n",
    "Let's discuss key constraints. They are a very important concept in database systems, so we'll spend a whole chapter on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The current database model\n",
    "Let's have a look at your current database model first. In the last chapter, you specified attribute constraints, first and foremost data types. You also set not-null and unique constraints on certain attributes. This didn't actually change the structure of the model, so it still looks the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The database model with primary keys\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, the database will look slightly different. You'll add so-called primary keys to three different tables. You'll name them `id`. In the entity-relationship diagram, keys are denoted by underlined attribute names. Notice that you'll add a whole new attribute to the `professors` table, and you'll modify existing columns of the `organizations` and `universities` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a key?\n",
    "Before we go into the nitty-gritty of what a primary key actually is, let's look at keys in general. Typically a database table has an attribute, or a combination of multiple attributes, whose values are unique across the whole table. Such attributes identify a record uniquely. Normally, a table, as a whole, only contains unique records, meaning that the combination of all attributes is a key in itself. However, it's not called a key, but a **superkey**, if attributes from that combination can be removed, and the attributes still uniquely identify records. If all possible attributes have been removed but the records are still uniquely identifiable by the remaining attributes, we speak of a minimal superkey. This is the actual key. So a **key** is always minimal. Let's look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example\n",
    "Here's an example that I found in a textbook on database systems.\n",
    "```\n",
    "     license_no     | serial_no |    make    |  model  | year\n",
    "--------------------+-----------+------------+---------+------\n",
    " Texas ABC-739      | A69352    | Ford       | Mustang |    2\n",
    " Florida TVP-347    | B43696    | Oldsmobile | Cutlass |    5\n",
    " New York MPO-22    | X83554    | Oldsmobile | Delta   |    1\n",
    " California 432-TFY | C43742    | Mercedes   | 190-D   |   99\n",
    " California RSK-629 | Y82935    | Toyota     | Camry   |    4\n",
    " Texas RSK-629      | U028365   | Jaguar     | XJS     |    4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Obviously, the table shows six different cars, so the combination of all attributes is a superkey. If we remove the `year` attribute from the superkey, the six records are still unique, so it's still a superkey. Actually, there are a lot of possible superkeys in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are only four minimal superkeys, and these are `license_no`, `serial_no`, and `model`, as well as the combination of `make` and `year`. Remember that superkeys are minimal if no attributes can be removed without losing the uniqueness property. This is trivial for K1 to 3, as they only consist of a single attribute. Also, if we remove `year` from K4, `make` would contain duplicates, and would, therefore, be no longer suited as key. These four minimal superkeys are also called candidate keys. Why candidate keys? In the end, there can only be one key for the table, which has to be chosen from the candidates. "

    "## Primary keys\n",
    "Now it's time to look at an actual use case for superkeys, keys, and candidate keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary keys\n",
    "Primary keys are one of the most important concepts in database design. Almost every database table should have a primary key – chosen by you from the set of candidate keys. The main purpose, as already explained, is uniquely identifying records in a table. This makes it easier to reference these records from other tables, for instance – a concept you will go through in the next and last chapter. You might have already guessed it, but primary keys need to be defined on columns that don't accept duplicate or null values. Lastly, primary key constraints are time-invariant, meaning that they must hold for the current data in the table – but also for any future data that the table might hold. It is therefore wise to choose columns where values will always be unique and not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying primary keys\n",
    "So these two tables accept exactly the same data, however, the latter has an explicit primary key specified. \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "\tproduct_no integer UNIQUE NIT NULL,\n",
    "\tname text,\n",
    "\tprice numeric\n",
    ");\n",
    "CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "\tproduct_no integer PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "\tname text,\n",
    "\tprice numeric\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, specifying primary keys upon table creation is very easy. Primary keys can also be specified like so: This notation is necessary if you want to designate more than one column as the primary key. Beware, that's still only one primary key, it is just formed by the combination of two columns. Ideally, though, primary keys consist of as few columns as possible.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE example (\n",
    "\ta integer,\n",
    "\tb integer,\n",
    "\tc integer,\n",
    "\tPRIMARY KEY (a, c)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Adding primary key constraints to existing tables is the same procedure as adding unique constraints, which you might remember from the last chapter. As with unique constraints, you have to give the constraint a certain name.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT some_name PRIMARY KEY (column_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your database\n",
    "In the exercises that follow, you will add primary keys to the tables \"universities\" and \"organizations\". You will add a special type of primary key, a so-called surrogate key, to the table \"professors\" in the last part of this chapter."

    "There are several reasons for creating an artificial surrogate key. As mentioned before, **a primary key is ideally constructed from as few columns as possible**. Secondly, **the primary key of a record should never change over time**. If you define an artificial primary key, ideally consisting of a unique number or string, you can be sure that this number stays the same for each record. Other attributes might change, but the primary key always has the same value for a given record.\n",

    "```\n",
    "I altered it slightly and added the `color` column. In this table, the `license_no` column would be suited as the primary key – the license number is unlikely to change over time, not like the color column, for example, which might change if the car is repainted.

    "```\n",
    "    make    |  model  | color\n",

Once you add a column with the `serial` type, all the records in your table will be numbered. Whenever you add a new record to the table, it will automatically get a number that does not exist yet. There are similar data types in other database management systems, like MySQL.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you try to specify an ID that already exists, the primary key constraint will prevent you from doing so. So, after all, the `id` column uniquely identifies each record in this table – which is very useful, for example, when you want to refer to these records from another table. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another type of surrogate key\n",
    "Another strategy for creating a surrogate key is to combine two existing columns into a new one. In this example, we first add a new column with the `varchar` data type.

This was not necessary for organizations and universities, as their names can be assumed to be unique across these tables.
