    "## Model 1:N relationships with foreign keys\n",
    "Now it's time to make use of key constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The current database model\n",
    "Here's your current database model. The three entity types `professors`, `organizations`, and `universities` all have primary keys – but `affiliations` doesn't, for a specific reason that will be revealed in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The next database model\n",
    "Next up, you'll model a so-called relationship type between `professors` and `universities`. As you know, in your database, each professor works for a university. In the ER diagram, this is drawn with a rhombus. The small numbers specify the cardinality of the relationship: a professor works for at most one university, while a university can have any number of professors working for it – even zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing relationships with foreign keys\n",
    "Such relationships are implemented with foreign keys. Foreign keys are designated columns that point to a primary key of another table. There are some restrictions for foreign keys. First, the domain and the data type must be the same as one of the primary key. Secondly, only foreign key values are allowed that exist as values in the primary key of the referenced table. This is the actual foreign key constraint, also called \"referential integrity\". You'll dig into referential integrity at the end of this chapter. Lastly, a foreign key is not necessarily an actual key, because duplicates and `NULL` values are allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A query\n",
    "As you can see, the column `university_shortname` of `professors` has the same domain as the `id` column of the `universities` table. If you go through each record of `professors`, you can always find the respective `id` in the `universities` table. So both criteria for a foreign key in the table `professors` referencing `universities` are fulfilled. Also, you see that `university_shortname` is not really a key because there are duplicates. For example, the id `EPF` and `UBE` occur three times each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying foreign keys\n",
    "When you create a new table, you can specify a foreign key similarly to a primary key. Let's look at two example tables. First, we create a `manufacturers` table with a primary key called `name`. Then we create a table `cars`, that also has a primary key, called `model`. As each car is produced by a certain manufacturer, it makes sense to also add a foreign key to this table. We do that by writing the `REFERENCES` keyword, followed by the referenced table and its primary key in brackets. From now on, only cars with valid and existing manufacturers may be entered into that table. Trying to enter models with manufacturers that are not yet stored in the `manufacturers` table won't be possible, thanks to the foreign key constraint.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE manufactures (\n",
    "\tname varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY);\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO manufacturers\n",
    "VALUES ('Ford'), ('VW'), ('GM');\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE cars (\n",
    "\tmodel varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "\tmanufacturer_name varchar(255) REFERENCES manufacturers (name));\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO cars\n",
    "VALUES ('Ranger', 'Ford'), ('Beetle', 'VW');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying foreign keys to existing tables\n",
    "Again, the syntax for adding foreign keys to existing tables is the same as the one for adding primary keys and unique constraints.\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "## Model more complex relationships\n",
    "In the last few exercises, you made your first steps in modeling and implementing 1:N-relationships. Now it's time to look at more complex relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The current database model\n",
    "So you've added a 1:N-relationship between professors and universities. Such relationships have to be implemented with one foreign key in the table that has at most one foreign entity associated. In this case, that's the `professors` table, as professors cannot have more than one university associated. Now, what about affiliations? We know that a professor can have more than one affiliation with organizations, for instance, as a chairman of a bank and as a president of a golf club. On the other hand, organizations can also have more than one professor connected to them. Let's look at the entity-relationship diagram that models this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The final database model\n",
    "There are a couple of things that are new. First of all, a new relationship between organizations and professors was added. This is an N:M relationship, not an 1:N relationship as with professors and universities. This depicts the fact that a professor can be affiliated with more than one organization and vice versa. Also, it has an own attribute, the function. Remember that each affiliation comes with a function, for instance, \"chairman\". The second thing you'll notice is that the affiliations entity type disappeared altogether. For clarity, I still included it in the diagram, but it's no longer needed. However, you'll still have four tables: Three for the entities \"professors\", \"universities\" and \"organizations\", and one for the N:M-relationship between \"professors\" and \"organizations\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to implement N:M-relationships\n",
    "Such a relationship is implemented with an ordinary database table that contains two foreign keys that point to both connected entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, that's a foreign key pointing to the `professors.id` column, and one pointing to the `organizations.id` column. Also, additional attributes, in this case `function`, need to be included. If you were to create that relationship table from scratch, you would define it as shown. Note that `professor_id` is stored as `integer`, as the primary key it refers to has the type `serial`, which is also an integer. On the other hand, `organization_id` has `varchar(256)` as type, conforming to the primary key in the `organizations` table. One last thing: Notice that **no primary key is defined** here because a professor can theoretically have multiple functions in one organization. One could define the combination of all three attributes as the primary key in order to have some form of unique constraint in that table, but that would be a bit over the top.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE affiliations (\n",
    "    professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id),\n",

    "## Referential integrity\n",
    "We'll now talk about one of the most important concepts in database systems: **referential integrity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a very simple concept that states that a record referencing another record in another table must always refer to an existing record. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: **A record in table A cannot point to a record in table B that does not exist**. Referential integrity is a constraint that always concerns **two tables**, and is **enforced through foreign keys**, as you've seen in the previous lessons of this chapter. So if you define a foreign key in the table `professors` referencing the table `universities`, referential integrity is held from `professors` to `universities`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referential integrity violations\n",
    "Referential integrity can be violated in two ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say table A references table B. So if a record in table B that is already referenced from table A is deleted, you have a violation. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you try to insert a record in table A that refers to something that does not exist in table B, you also violate the principle. And that's the main reason for foreign keys – they will throw errors and stop you from accidentally doing these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with violations\n",
    "However, throwing an error is not the only option. If you specify a foreign key on a column, you can actually tell the database system what should happen if an entry in the referenced table is deleted. By default, the `ON DELETE NO ACTION` keyword is automatically appended to a foreign key definition, like in the example here. \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE a (\n",
    "    id integer PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    column_a varchar(64),\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you try to delete a record in table B which is referenced from table A, the system will throw an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other options. For example, there's the `CASCADE` option, which will first allow the deletion of the record in table B, and then will automatically delete all referencing records in table A. So that deletion is cascaded.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE a (\n",
    "    id integer PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    column_a varchar(64),\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE CASCADE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with violations, contd.\n",
    "There are even more options. The `RESTRICT` option is almost identical to the `NO ACTION` option. The differences are technical and beyond the scope of this course. More interesting is the `SET NULL` option. It will set the value of the foreign key for this record to `NULL`. The `SET DEFAULT` option only works if you have specified a default value for a column. It automatically changes the referencing column to a certain default value if the referenced record is deleted. Setting default values is also beyond the scope of this course, but this option is still good to know."

    "Let's quickly revise what you've done throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How you've transformed the database\n",
    "You started with a simple table with a lot of redundancy. You might be used to such tables when working with flat files like CSVs or Excel files. Throughout the course, you transformed it step by step into the database schema on the right – only by executing SQL queries. You've defined column data types, added primary keys and foreign keys, and through that, specified relationships between tables. All these measures will guarantee better data consistency and therefore quality. This is especially helpful if you add new data to the database but also makes analyzing the data easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The database ecosystem\n",
    "To go further from here, it's useful to look at the bigger picture for a minute. In this course, you've transformed a database. You did that with PostgreSQL, which is also called a \"Database Management System\", or DBMS. The DBMS and one or more databases together form the \"Database System\". The DBMS exposes a query interface where you can run ad-hoc analyses and queries with SQL. However, you can also access this interface through other client applications. You could, for example, program a Python script that connects to the database, loads data from it, and visualizes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this course, you'll no longer manipulate data in your database system, but employ some analysis queries on your database. This will be a quick repetition of what you've learned in previous SQL courses such as \"Intro to SQL for Data Science\", but it will also demonstrate the advantages of having a database instead of a flat file in the first place."

Of course, you could also put `university_city` and `organization_sector` in their own tables, making the data model even more formal. However, in database design, you have to strike a balance between modeling overhead, desired data consistency, and usability for queries like the one you've just wrote.*"
