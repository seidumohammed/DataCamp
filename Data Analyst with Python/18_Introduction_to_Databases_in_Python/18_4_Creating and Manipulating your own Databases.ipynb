    "Creating databases is different for every database type, and it often requires the use of a command line tool or management application. All these tools are beyond the scope of this class. However with SQLite, if you supply a filename that does not exist to the create_engine method, it will create that file which creates the database.\n",

    "In this example, we are creating a table to store data about our `employees`. We've already created an engine and metadata. We want to store the `employee`'s `id`, `name`, `salary`, and `active` status. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing everything we need. This includes the Table and Column objects along with any SQL Data types we want to use in our columns. There are many SQL Data types, and the SQLAlchemy documentation is a great place to see all the ones that are available. Next, we use the Table object to create a table named employees, in our metadata with a few columns. The first column is the id column and we made it an integer type to store the employees id. Next we have the name column which is a String that can be up to 255 characters long. Next we have the salary column which is a decimal type to hold the employees yearly salary. The last column is the active column which is a Boolean to let us know if they are still actively employed. We store that table object as employees. Now, we use the `create_all` method on the metadata objects and pass it the engine to create the table in the database itself. Finally, we use the `table_names` method of the engine to verify that the table was created."

    "### Creating tables\n",
    "As you saw in the prior example, creating tables can be done with SQLAlchemy just like queries. We will still use the Table object similar to how we used it for reflection. We'll just remove the `autoload` keyword arguments and replace them with the Column objects we want to exist in the table. Once we have our table object, we can use the metadata's `create_all` method and the engine to create the table in the actual database. While it's easy to create tables with SQLAlchemy, if you want to make changes to an existing table structure, such as adding or removing columns, you'll need to build raw SQL ALTER statements or use a tool like Alembic, which is outside the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating tables - additional column options\n",
    "In addition to Columns having a type, they can also have constraints and defaults that are additional keyword arguments to the Column object. With constraints we can require that a column be `unique` or specify that a column can not be empty or null. There other more complex constraints as well that can be used to require any Boolean condition you can imagine. `Default` sets the initial value of a field if one is not supplied during an insert statement. Let's create a table with some constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a table with additional options\n",
    "We're going to create the same employees table; however, we want to make sure the name column is unique and not allowed to be empty. We established a default salary of 100.00, and also set active to be True by default. Finally, we check to see what constraints are on the table using the constraints attribute. We can see that our desired constraints and defaults are in place.\n"

You can read a CSV file into a DataFrame using the `read_csv()` function (this function should be familiar to you, but you can run `help(pd.read_csv)` in the console to refresh your memory!). Then, you can call the [`.to_sql()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html) method on the DataFrame to load it into a SQL table in a database. The columns of the DataFrame should match the columns of the SQL table.\n",

    "- `name` is the name of the SQL table (as a string).\n",

    "- `if_exists` specifies how to behave if the table already exists in the database; possible values are `\"fail\"`, `\"replace\"`, and `\"append\"`.\n",
    "- `index` (`True` or `False`) specifies whether to write the DataFrame's index as a column.\n",

    "###  Deleting data from a table\n",
    "First to delete data from a table, we use the `delete()` statement. The `delete()` statement targets a table and uses a `where()` clause to determine which rows to delete. It's not simple or fast to restore large databases or tables if you delete them so be very cautious when using the delete statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting all data from a table\n",
    "In this example, we are going to delete all the data from a table named `extra_employees`. We start by importing the delete statement. next we're going to build a select statement to count the records in the `extra_employees` table in order to make sure that we delete the correct number of records. We execute the statement and use the scalar fetch method to get just the number of records back. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import delete\n",

    "\n",
    "Then we build a `delete()` statement that targets the `extra_employees` table without a `where` clause. Now we execute the `delete()` statement and check the row count to make sure it matches the count from our `select()` statement.\n",

    "Here we are removing employee 3 from the employees table. We begin by building a `delete()` statement for the `employees` table and use a `where` clause to target the employee with the ID of 3. Then we execute the statement and check the row count to make sure we only removed one record.\n",

We pass the engine in as an argument to specify which database we are dropping the table from. Dropping a table only removes it and the data it holds from the database, and does not remove it from metadata or our table object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropping a table\n",
    "In this example, we are going to drop the `extra_employees` table. We call the drop method on the table and pass it the engine that points to our database. Finally, we verify that it was deleted by using the exists method with the engine to check if it is still there.\n",

    "\n",
    "So to completely empty the database we are using, we call the `drop_all()` method and pass in the engine to specify which database we are working on. Finally when we check the `table_names` on the engine object, we can see that there are no more tables.\n",
